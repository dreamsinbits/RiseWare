# Introduction

RiseWare is a custom ESP32 firmware designed to control bread makers with dynamic, 
user-defined recipes. 
Unlike conventional bread makers that relies on static, built-in programs, 
RiseWare allows hobbyist bakers to create and load their own recipes in real-time.

It provides a client for mobile and cloud applications, 
enabling seamless setup and management of personalized baking processes. 
With full control over kneading, 
heating and ingredient dispensing (such as yeast and raisins), 
RiseWare empowers users to bake any type of bread they can imagine.
